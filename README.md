**RESUME_SCANNER**

# OBJECTIVE:

Matching the best profiles to a job description may be a difficult and time-consuming task. In fact, the traditional way that recruiters are using to select candidates does not take into consideration all important details. Recruiters have to screen all the applications manually and then calculate the similarity in an efficient way.
In this project, I have created a program to see the similarity between resume/CV and the job description. This could be a good way to see how well any particular resume matches with the requirements of any job profile.

The main objective of the project is to create an application which will match the Resume with the given job description and tries to pick the best Resume/CV (docx format) for the particular Job description.

# Project Summary:

1. Import the necessary libraries.
2. Load the data in the word format.
3. Convert the word format to text format.
4. Store the Job description in the same format.
5. Count the frequency of words occur in the resume to find the best one.
6. Display the words and the number of times it occured in the resume.

# Outcome:
1. It can pick the resume document in both format pdf and word.
2. It can also take the different job description from user in word and compare the one resume at a time.
3. It can also give the list of words with its count in the resume.
4. Piece of code turned into web application using package.

# Future prospects:
planning to add more pages in the web application and generate more useful insights from the given resume.
planning to implement to genrate match percentage for a bulk of resumes and gives the best resume on top.
planing to expand this by connecting postgre sql database.
it may end up a great HR system.
